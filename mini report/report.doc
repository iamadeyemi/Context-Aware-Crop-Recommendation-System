IOT AND MACHINE LEARNING TO CREATE A CONTEXT-AWARE CROP RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Abstract
The increasing global demand for food, coupled with climate change and environmental uncertainties, necessitates innovative approaches to agricultural productivity. This study presents the development of an IoT-based crop recommendation system utilizing machine learning techniques to assist farmers in making informed decisions. The system integrates real-time environmental data, including soil composition, temperature, and moisture levels, with historical agricultural datasets to generate optimal crop recommendations. Machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), were evaluated for their predictive accuracy in crop recommendation tasks. Results indicate that XGBoost and Random Forest demonstrated superior accuracy (82.54%) in predicting suitable crops, outperforming SVM and ANN.
Background of Study
Farmers face significant challenges such as crop losses and low yields due to reliance on conventional practices. Existing models like Stochastic Dynamic Programming and Many Objectives Robust Decision-Making Model (MORDMAgro) lack real-time adaptability. This project addresses these gaps by developing an IoT-based crop recommendation system that uses machine learning to provide dynamic, data-driven insights.
